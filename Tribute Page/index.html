            <h2>Quick summary of Shadov:</h2>
            <p>
                Shadobtsa is a very important individual of tee who has emerged victorious
                in races and has achieved a noteble status of <i>Father of Teeworlds</i> also
                most commonly known as <i>Otetc tiworldsa</i>. He is also a liberator having killed
                blockers and failers thus making map completion possible. It is said that
                his hook never misses and all his triple granade jumps are always successful.
                He has the most amount of points on ddnet but due to a bug site displays
                an incorrect amount of points.
            </p>

            <h2>Vast and triumphant Shadoba's exploits:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>He completed Adrenaline 4 with two dummies named FapMan and kezo.</li>
                <li>He has top -1 in many maps.</li>
                <li>He has donated 0 rubles to support ddnet servers.</li>
                <li>
                    He has the lowest fail rating out of all other tees. On averege, only
                    95% of fails is his fault, when for example kezo's fail rating is 100%.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He is the admin of ddnet and can force ban anyone who is not accepting
                    his pride and glory.

                    Always remember to turn on tile entities before proceeding with the part.
                    Mapmakers are all sons of bitches and will make sure that you will fail
                    if your judgment lapses for even a second, and atrocious textures will make
                    sure of that. Also never trust kezo with anything; he will fail and than say
                    that you shouldn't have distracted him. And remember, if you get killed, first
                    type "он меня кильнуд" into chat and then vote kick with reason "hooker".
